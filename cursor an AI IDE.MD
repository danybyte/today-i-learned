My First Experience with Cursor IDE
I heard about Cursor a while ago, and although it piqued my interest, I never got around to trying it. That changed last night when I suddenly remembered it and decided to finally install it and share my experience here.

First Impressions
After installing and signing up, the first thing that struck me was how familiar it felt—the environment is remarkably similar to VS Code, which made the transition seamless.

Diving into the AI Features
Once I got past the shortcut intros, I headed straight for the "secret sauce": the AI Features. Since I was on the free tier, I used the Auto mode (which selects the best model for you). I noticed several modes available:

Debug

Ask

Agent

Plain

I chose Agent mode for my first test. I asked it to optimize a very sluggish part of my website. It handled it brilliantly! The most impressive part was when it sent a notification asking for permission to install a specific library it needed to complete the task.

Putting "Debug" to the Test
For my second test, I used the Debug mode to fix a section of the site that fetches data from an external API. Not only did it complete the task, but it also showed a clear "diff"—highlighting exactly which lines were added or removed. It gave me full control to either Accept or Reject the changes.

Final Thoughts
Overall, it was a "fast" and fascinating experience.

Fast, because I hit my free usage limits pretty quickly!

Fascinating, because of the sheer convenience.

In a standard IDE, you're constantly copying and pasting code back and forth between your editor and an AI chat. In Cursor, that friction is gone. You just tell it what to do, and it executes. It's a game-changer for workflow efficiency.
